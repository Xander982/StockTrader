Well, step 1 is to define a goal.  That's pretty obvious - beat the market in a robust way.
        Beat SP500 for one year
        Reduce volatility of portfolio
        Same or better return with less losses versus VOO


        Second goal same or better return with less losses versus standard diversified portfolio (ticker for ETF here)




Step 2 is to make a strategy.  
1. Technical indicators-  extracted features about stock price is my first attempt.  
2. Sentiment - news articles, twitter articles.  
3. Fundamentals - which tries to use financial metrics of a company to determine whether the price will go up or down. 
4. Marketplace analysis- federal reserve rates and bond purchases.  Government spending, deficits, debt. Consumer debt levels.  Consumer confidence.  Trade policy.  Politics.




Step 3 is to get the data set. 
1. Sprint one is technical indicators so data set is just one year of end of trading day prices.
   1. https://towardsdatascience.com/best-5-free-stock-market-apis-in-2019-ad91dddec984
   2. Pip install finance
   3. Download year of finance.yahoo.com prices
   4. I think that this should work.
2. Sprint two is fundamentals trading so data set is one year of financials.
   1. Web page scraping: Yahoo Finance (?)
3. Sprint three is market conditions including federal reserve data.
4. Sprint four is sentiment. Twitter scraping. Natural language processing.
